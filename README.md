# 🚀 C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Journey

Welcome to my C++ OOP learning repository! 👋

This repository documents my journey in mastering **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts using C++. It contains a collection of mini-projects ranging from basic Class/Object instantiation to complex Polymorphism and Memory Management.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
In this repository, I demonstrated practical implementation of:
- **Classes & Objects**: Blueprints, Instantiation, and Memory allocation.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding using `private`, `protected`, and `public` access modifiers.
- **Inheritance**: Parent-Child class relationships and Constructor Chaining.
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions, Method Overriding, and Dynamic Binding.
- **Pointers & Memory**: Managing Array of Pointers and dynamic object creation (`new`).
- **Logic Building**: Input validation, Loops, and Control Flow (Menu Systems).

## 🛠️ How to Run
You can compile these files using any C++ compiler (like GCC/G++).

**Example using Terminal/Command Prompt:**
```bash
# 1. Compile the file (e.g., the Cinema project)
g++ 05_polymorphism_final.cpp -o cinema_app

# 2. Run the program
./cinema_app
